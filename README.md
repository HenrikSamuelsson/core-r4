# CoreR4

CoreR4 is a learning-focused project that explores the Arduino Uno R4 Wi-Fi from the ground up, bypassing the Arduino framework to work directly with the Renesas RA4M1 microcontroller. The goal is to understand and control the hardware at a low level using bare-metal techniques and minimal abstractions.
